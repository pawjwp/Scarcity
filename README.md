## About

Scarcity adds options to make resources a bit more scarce, including configurable hunger values, nerfed falling block physics, limited water bottle pickup, and seeds for trees and crops that are missing them.

This mod was created for my modpack, [Desolate Planet](https://modrinth.com/modpack/desolate-planet/), but the features it adds will hopefully be useful to other modpacks as well.

## Features

- Configurable hunger and saturation rates
  - Hunger depletion rate from:
    - Movement, including walking, sprinting, jumping, swimming, and more
    - Attacking and taking damage
    - Global exhaustion gain rate
    - Optional passive exhaustion drain
  - Regeneration, including:
    - Fast and slow regeneration rates
    - Hunger level thresholds at which fast and slow regeneration occur
    - Hunger depletion rate during regeneration
- Limited water bottle pickup, consuming the water source block and filling four bottles at a time
- Falling block breaking adjustments, giving them a chance to break and partial blocks they land on (chance is based on the broken block's hardness)
- Seeds for various plants that normally would not have them (these are intended for modpack makers on skyblock-style maps and do not spawn or drop naturally)
  - Seeds for all vanilla saplings (oak, spruce, birch, jungle, acacia, dark oak, cherry, but not including non-sapling trees like mangrove, crimson, or warped)
  - Seeds for foods that don't already have them (potatoes, carrots, and sweet berries)
  - Seeds for other plants (cactus, sugar cane, and bamboo)
  - Seeds for some other modded plants (currently just Farmer's Delight Onion and Thermal's rubberwood sapling)
